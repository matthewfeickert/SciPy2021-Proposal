### Overall evaluation

Thank you for submitting this proposed talk!
I think its very interesting to see a Python implementation out perform a C++ one.
While I was reading the proposal a few questions came to mind that you may want to address.

* Does the Python implementation out perform C++ with numpy as the default backend?
* GPU support is mentioned, but has pyhf been tested with CuPy?
* What are the typical data sizes on disk and in-memory?
* How are the datasets loaded? (backend dependent?)

Additionally, I think it would be interesting to talk about potential applications outside of HEP.
Also, please be sure to provide the meaning of abbreviations the first time they are mentioned, for example probability density functions (pdfs).
This looks like it would be a great talk!
