# Talk Proposal Reviewer Comments

The talk submission "Distributed statistical inference with pyhf powered by funcX" was selected for presentation at SciPy 2021 (in the Physics and Astronomy mini-symposia).

SciPy practices a double-open review system.
The following are the reviews for the submission:

- **SUBMISSION:** 89
- **TITLE:** Distributed statistical inference with pyhf powered by funcX
- **AUTHORS:** Matthew Feickert, Lukas Heinrich, Giordon Stark, and Ben Galewsky

## Review 1

**Overall evaluation:** 3 (strong accept)

### Overall evaluation

NB: my domain of expertise was astronomy.

This talk would introduce:

1) pyhf, a library for simultaneous fitting of many models to binned data from high-energy physics experiments
2) funcX, a library that eases interactions with queue-based HPC systems

Here are my answers to the review questions on the scipy conference website:

> Is the abstract clear?

Yes. No jargon was used; I didn't need expertise in HEP.

> Is the abstract complete?

Yes.

> Is the abstract compelling?

Yes. I would attend this talk (and probably will).

> How relevant, immediately useful, and novel is the topic?

I probably could have used funcX during my first postdoc, which is to say that managing queue-scheduled computations with Python is immediately useful.
The abstract makes the problem seem like low-hanging fruit for which the solution will be applicable to a large audience.
